About This Form

This is a basic contact form that allows users to enter their **name**, **email address**, and a **message**. Before the form is submitted, it checks that:

* The name contains only letters and is at least 2 characters long
* The email address is in a valid format
* The message is not empty and contains at least 10 characters

If any of the fields are incorrect or missing, an error message will be shown, and the form will not be submitted.

Once all fields are filled in correctly, the form will take the user to a separate "Thank You" page to confirm that their message has been received.
